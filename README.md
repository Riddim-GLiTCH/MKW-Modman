<p align="center"> An in-development mod manager for Mario Kart Wii</p>

MKW-ModMan is a Mod Manager for Mario Kart Wii, that aims to streamline the act of downloading and installing mods from [The Custom Mario Kart Wiki](https://wiki.tockdom.com).

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently in its earliest stage of development, and is currently not functional.

> Notice:
>
> Due to API limitatations, the ability to download mods directly from [The Custom Mario Kart Wiki](https://wiki.tockdom.com) will not be developed yet. However, a potential work-around is being considered.
>
> Furthermore, the this project can still serve as a graphical user interface to manage your mods. This part of the project will still be worked on.

### This is what I aim to achieve in this project:
 - Manage MyStuff folders and automatically generate the required XML data for Riivolution.
 - An easy-to-use interface to install base-mods* on both a Wii SD-card/USB Flash Drive and the Dolphin Load folder.
 - Manage contents of MyStuff folders included with base-mods*.

\*Base-mods are mods that make fundamental changes to the game. Examples include: Formula Kart Wii, Hide and Seek, CTGP-Revolution, and Mario Kart Midnight.


##### This project is my first endeavour in C# programing, And I am being guided in this by my close friend [`@EnkDev`](https://github.com/EnkDev). Huge shoutout to them for their help and support!
