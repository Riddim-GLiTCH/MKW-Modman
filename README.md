### This is what I aim to achieve in this project:
 - Manage MyStuff folders and automatically generate the required XML data for Riivolution.
 - An easy-to-use interface to install base-mods* on both a Wii SD-card/USB Flash Drive and the Dolphin Load folder.
 - Manage contents of MyStuff folders included with base-mods*.

\*Base-mods are mods that make fundamental changes to the game. Examples include: Formula Kart Wii, Hide and Seek, CTGP-Revolution, and Mario Kart Midnight.


##### This project is my first endeavour in C# programing, And I am being guided in this by my close friend [`@EnkDev`](https://github.com/EnkDev). Huge shoutout to them for their help and support!
