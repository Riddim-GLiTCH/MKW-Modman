# TODO Tracker

---
There are quite some things that should be done.<br/>
So as a matter of fact, here is a list of things that should give an overview of what is being worked on.

---

- [ ] Look into MAUI during the time of the development to provide a cross-platform GUI solution.<br/>
- [ ] Get into talks with Krummers so the Wiiki API can be integrated with all the necessary endpoints.
- [ ] Maybe acquire an obfuscated Wiiki-API Key that can only be read by the app
- [ ] Setup a Core Library for all types of Mkw.ModManager apps
- [ ] Eat some ice cream :>
